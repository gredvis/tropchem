    "# Ozone formation in an urban plume\n",
    "The formation of ozone in an urban plume is demonstrated using a simple photochemical box model with a minimum number of species and reactions. In the following, the terms VOC (volatile organic compounds) and ROG (reactive organic gases) will be used as synonyms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following assumptions are made:\n",
    "* An air mass travels on a sunny summer day at constant speed of 5 m/s across a 10 km wide city.\n",
    "* The air mass represents a well mixed planetary boundary layer of constant depth.\n",
    "* Before reaching the city, the air mass is rather clean with low initial NO$_x$, VOC and O$_3$ concentrations.\n",
    "* Over the city, which extends from 5 - 15 km along the air path (highlighted as grey box in the figure), NO$_x$ and VOCs are emitted at constant rates.\n",
    "* The NO:NO$_2$ ratio in the emissions is assumed to be 10:1.\n",
    "* Once leaving the city, emissions stop and NO$_x$ and VOCs start being consumed by reactions with OH. At the same time, O$_3$ is formed through a coupled NO$_x$ - HO$_x$ reaction cycle.\n",
    "* The net O$_3$ formation in the plume is analyzed by comparing the O$_3$ concentration 80 km downwind of the city to the inital $O_3$ concentration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following chemical reactions are considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>ROG + OH -> HO$_2$, $k_1$\n",
    "  <li>HO$_2$ + NO -> OH + NO$_2$, $k_2$\n",
    "  <li>NO + O$_3$ -> NO$_2$ + O$_2$, $k_3$\n",
    "  <li>NO$_2$ + O$_2$ -> NO + O$_3$, $k_4$\n",
    "  <li>NO$_2$ + OH -> HNO$_3$, $k_5$\n",
    "  <li>O$_3$ + H$_2$O -> O$_2$ + 2 OH, $k_6$\n",
    "  <li>2 HO$_2$ -> O$_2$ + H$_2$O$_2$, $k_7$\n",
    "  <li>O$_3$ + HO$_2$ -> OH + 2 O$_2$, $k_8$\n",
    "  <li>OH + HO$_2$ -> H$_2$O + O$_2$, $k_9$\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "The system of coupled differential equations is integrated with a QSSA (Quasi-steady-state approximation) solver as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"qssa.png\" width=600 align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "with P$_x$ denoting all source terms of species X and D$_x$ all loss terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was originally written in Fortran by Joachim Orb (ETH), then ported to php by Jörg Mäder (ETH), and finally to python by Dominik Brunner (Empa).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the form below you may play with the inital concentrations, the emission rates and the temperature. \n",
